"""
This directory contains pytest tests for the application.
It is best practice to create a parallel directory structure to the application code, so that tests can be easily located and maintained. Tests for a file `path/filename.py` should be located in `tests/path/test_filename.py`.
The `test_*` prefix for test files is a pytest convention, and is used to automatically discover tests when running `pytest` from the command line.
